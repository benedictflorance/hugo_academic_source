- Presented an excellent fault-tolerant PennCloud platform that supports a complete set of services with an intuitive user interface, including e.g., a webmail service for both local and remote users, a storage service for uploading and downloading of large files in any format, and an admin console for viewing and easy controlling of frontend and backend nodes' status and data. 
- Foundational to these services, the platform also features a solid, scalable system design with strong consistency, efficient fault detection and recovery, fast performance and great usability.
- This project was included in the [Hall of Fame](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis5050/hall_of_fame.html) for being well-done in every aspect.
