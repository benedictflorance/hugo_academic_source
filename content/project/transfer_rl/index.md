- Used transfer learning to achieve the fast lap times in OpenAIâ€™s Car racing environment by training the agent on one circuit, and racing it on other
customized target environments by zero-shot transfer or by additional fine-tuning. 
- Compared the performance of
model-based and model-free approaches, and observed that model-based approaches dominate in performance and converge
faster than model-free approaches in this environment.
- Observed that transfer learning in most setups not only boosts the
performance on the target domain, but also shows high performance ability during learning.
