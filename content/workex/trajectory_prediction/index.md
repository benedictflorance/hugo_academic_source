- Developed data, pre-processing and modeling pipeline for Transformers, GNNs-based trajectory prediction architecture that acts on vectorized map and agent information. 
- Improved prediction quality through lossless and long-range feature
representation, reduced prediction latency by 20%, and improved training and validation speeds by 33%.
