I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cruise](https://getcruise.com/) developing a critical component that predicts trajectories of actors around Cruise’s autonomous vehicle (AV), enabling the car to drive safely, comfortably, and human-like. I am broadly interested at the juncture of deep learning and computer vision, with forays into RL and NLP. I aim to solve challenging and meaningful real-world problems, like self-driving, through the power of AI.

Previously, I received my MSE in CIS from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) and  B. Tech. (Honors) in CS from [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu). In the past, I have been fortunate to work with amazing mentors, Prof. [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/) ([GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/), [Penn](https://www.upenn.edu/)), Prof. [Eric Granger](https://www.etsmtl.ca/professeurs/egranger/accueil?lang=en-CA) ([LIVIA lab](https://www.etsmtl.ca/unites-de-recherche/livia/accueil), [ETS Montreal](https://www.etsmtl.ca/)), Prof. [C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) ([CVIT lab](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/)), and Prof. [Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/) ([VAL Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/), [IISc Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/)).

I am also a recipient of several prestigious awards like the [University of Pennsylvania's Excellence in Team Leadership](https://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/), [Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/aimasters/), [Mitacs Globalink Graduate Fellowship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-graduate-fellowship) and [Indian Academy of Sciences’ Summer Research Fellowship](https://www.ias.ac.in/).
