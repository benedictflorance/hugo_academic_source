- Wrote data-loaders and modeled the architecture for kinematic-structure preserving, unsupervised 3D pose estimation
framework to effectively disentangle pose, foreground and background appearance information.

- Reduced MPJPE by as high
as 40% (semi-supervised) and 15% (unsupervised) on datasets like Human3.6M, 3DHP, LSP and 3DPW.
